# MEMORA - An Alzheimer Remediation App
# Inspiration
Our journey began with a simple belief: memories are worth holding onto. Inspired by my great-grandmother's experience with dementia, we envisioned a way to help families navigate the challenging road of memory loss. The hackathon's "Road Trip" theme perfectly captured our vision â€“ using technology to revisit cherished moments and map out a personalized route through the past.

# What it does
Memora is a mobile app that acts as a personalized road map through memories, designed for individuals in the early to moderate stages of dementia and their families. Using personal family photos â€“ snapshots from life's journey â€“ Memora stimulates memory recall through engaging quizzes and a user-friendly interface.

# How we built it
Memora was built using React for the front end, leveraging Material UI for a user-friendly interface â€“ designed to be easy to navigate, like a well-planned road trip. Supabase provided the secure data storage we needed to keep our memories safe. Key technologies included Framer Motion for engaging animations, Lucide React for beautiful icons, and React Draggable and React Image Marker for intuitive photo tagging.

# Key features:
Contextual-Cue Based Quizzes: Engaging quizzes generated from tagged photos, acting as 'signposts' along the memory 'road trip,' prompting users to recall specific details about people, places, and events.

Scrollable Feed: A user-friendly, scrollable feed displaying photos, allowing for easy browsing and revisiting of cherished moments from the past.

Content Uploading: Easy uploading of photos, allowing families to add new 'destinations' to their memory 'road trip.'

Content Tagging: A simple and intuitive tagging system (People, Places, Events) to categorize photos and create rich contextual cues for memory retrieval, effectively mapping out the journey.
# Challenges we ran into
TAGGING PHOTOS :'(((

Coming together on a shared vision. It took a while to get the idea from idea to design.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully infiltrated Stetson East Dining Hall ðŸ˜ˆ

Kaleb and Slava slept in an MIT frat house. That's kinda legendary. ðŸ’¤ðŸ›Œ

Seeing the TikTok-like scrollable feed come to life was amazing ðŸ“±
# What we learned
# Teamwork:
Creating a detailed product brief together was essential. It provided a shared vision and roadmap for our project, ensuring effective collaboration throughout the development process.
Our late-night brainstorming sessions, especially on Friday, were incredibly productive. We learned to leverage each team member's strengths, challenge assumptions constructively, and arrive at innovative solutions.
# Technical:
Using AI mockup tools like Bolt was a valuable experience. We discovered how quickly and easily we could translate our ideas into visual representations, facilitating design iterations and improving communication within the team."
Working with our tech stack, while sometimes challenging due to rustiness in certain areas, reinforced our understanding of core web development principles and highlighted areas for future learning.
# Impact:
Tackling a real-world problem like supporting individuals with dementia gave our work a deeper purpose. It motivated us to consider the real-life impact of our design decisions and the potential to make a positive difference."
The practice of constantly asking 'Why?' when developing features became ingrained in our process. This user-centric approach ensured that every element of Memora was designed with the needs of our target audience in mind.
