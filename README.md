Memora – An Alzheimer Remediation App


🏆 HackBeanPot 2025 – 1st Place (“Leave No Trace – Social Impact / Sustainability”)

Memories are worth holding on to. Memora helps families navigate dementia by turning treasured photos into engaging, memory‑strengthening games.



🚀 Inspiration

My great‑grandmother’s struggle with dementia showed us how fragile memories can be. When HackBeanPot announced a “Road Trip” theme, we imagined using technology to let users re‑visit the landmarks of their lives—one photo at a time.



📱 What It Does

Memora is a mobile app that acts like a personalized road map through a user’s past:

Upload & Tag Photos — Add snapshots and tag People, Places, and Events.

AI‑Generated Quizzes — Contextual cues prompt the user to recall names, locations, and stories.

TikTok‑style Feed — An infinite scroll of memories keeps engagement fun and familiar.
